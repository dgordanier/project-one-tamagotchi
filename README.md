### USER STORY:
As a user I want to click "Start" to begin

As a user I want to enter a name for my Evil Elf

As a user (or AAU) I want to keep the Evil Elf alive as long as possible, so I will tend to the elf's 3 needs; Hunger, Sleepiness & Boredom.
    I will keep the Evil Elf fed with shakes made of blended reindeer parts -       Click the beverage icon to fill his belly
    I will keep sleepiness levels low by wrapping him up for sleep
    -      Click the gift box icon to wrap Evil Elf up for his slumber
    I will keep the Evil Elf's Bordem at bay by burning down trees
    -      Click the fire icon to scorch a spruce

AAU I may want to take revenge on the Evil Elf on behalf of the reindeer/forest
    -      Click the snow flake icon to dump snow and freeze Evil Elf

AAU I want to grow/evolve my Evil Elf so for every 5 minutes I keep Evil Elf alive it will grow 5% larger until full grown and will age 1 Elf year.

AAU if I allow any 2 of the 3 needs to get above 90% simultaneously the Evil Elf dies and the game will be restarted.
