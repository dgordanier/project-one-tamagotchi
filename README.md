### USER STORY:
As a user I want to click "Start" to begin

As a user I want to enter a name for my Evil Elf

As a user (or AAU) I want to keep the Evil Elf alive as long as possible, so I will tend to the elf's 3 needs; Hunger, Sleepiness & Boredom.
    I will keep the Evil Elf fed
    -       Click the candy cane icon to fill his belly
    I will keep sleepiness levels low
    -      Click the gift sleep icon to lower sleep levels
    I will keep the Evil Elf's Bordem at bay
    -      Click the gift box icon to lower boredom levels

AAU I want to grow/evolve my Evil Elf so for every 20 seconds I keep Evil Elf alive it will grow larger until full grown at age 3

AAU if I allow any of the 3 status bars to fill up entirely the Evil Elf dies

AAU I will refresh page to play again
